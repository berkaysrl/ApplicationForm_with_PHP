# ApplicationForm_with_PHP
<br>My first app with PHP back-end</br>
this project was a project that I created when I first started back-end coding, we mainly use SQL and PHP languages in general in the project 
we are dealing with a scholarship application. 
My background tables are not very smooth, they do not fit the relational database structure at all, but as I said, this is a project I created when 
I first started back-end coding.
